Define a FESTIVAL_PROLOG environment variable pointing to a text file
containing lisp statements like the following:

(voice_nitech_us_awb_arctic_hts)

But make sure your festival server already has the voices on it before it
was last started. Use the command (voice.list) in festival for choices.

You can also put in other statements as they will all be sent to the
server using festival_client before the voice processing takes place.
