chesstalk has a few different operating modes to speak and collect chess moves, through festival.

the most basic mode is to collect chess moves from stdin and to speak to the user after a certain interval to request another move and speak a status update.

the output is a .pgn file.

there is also an undo move feature.

Run DEBUG=3 ./chesstalk
to have additional verbose statements such as memory tree additions, deletions, and undo operations displayed to stdout.

Commands to use in the program.

Type 'help' to get a brief overview.

The basic operation is to start typing your moves as you play them on a real gaming board or on some other chess interface.

As you do so, the move you type will be announced through festival.

Use 'show' to see a current list of moves, that have been played.

Use 'save' to output that list of in-memory moves to an output.pgn file.

Quick tip for xboard viewing: xboard -ncp -boardSize medium -lgf ./output.pgn

Use 'quit' to exit gracefully, when you're done.

Compiling and installing

Usually you run commands like this to get started:

# utilize configure.ac and Makefile.am files to generate a configure script
# (stay in the base directory with README and configure.ac to run this)

autoreconf --force --install

mkdir compile
cd compile
../configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/chesstalk
make 
make install
